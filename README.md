# CSTP CAD Viewer

A single-file, no-build, browser-based viewer for CAD/survey drawings. Open
`index.html` directly (or serve it statically) — there's no server, no
dependencies, and nothing to install.

## What it does

- **↥ Import DXF** — reads `LINE`, `LWPOLYLINE`, `POLYLINE`/`VERTEX`, `POINT`,
  `CIRCLE`, and `3DFACE` entities out of a plain ASCII DXF file. Each
  entity's own DXF layer becomes a layer in the viewer.
- **↥ Import LandXML (TIN)** — reads a LandXML `<Surface>` (TIN: `Pnts` +
  `Faces`) as a triangulated surface layer, and any `<CgPoint>` records as
  plotted survey/COGO points. Multiple imports layer onto whatever's already
  loaded — you can bring in a DXF and a TIN together.
- **⛰ Elevation** — click a visible, unlocked TIN surface to read its
  interpolated elevation at that exact point (barycentric interpolation
  across whichever triangle you clicked). This is the actual payoff of
  importing a surface model: getting a spot elevation off it without CAD.
- **📑 Layers** — every imported DXF layer and TIN surface gets its own row:
  a **👁 visibility** checkbox (show/hide) and a **🔒 lock** checkbox (dims
  the layer and excludes it from the elevation query, without hiding it —
  the same distinction a real CAD lock makes).
- Pan by dragging, zoom with the mouse wheel (zooms toward the cursor).

## DWG — why it isn't supported directly

DWG is Autodesk's proprietary binary format. Reading it in a browser with no
bundled parser isn't practical: the open-source option (LibreDWG) is GPL-3.0
and still has real entity-coverage gaps, and a Civil3D **surface** or **COGO
point** object specifically is not a plain DWG entity at all — it's a
proprietary "object enabler" payload that even most third-party DWG readers
can't decode without Autodesk's own SDK for it.

Picking a `.dwg` file in the **↥ Import DWG** button doesn't silently fail or
pretend to work — it just tells you, in the status bar, to do one of these
instead (both are a couple of clicks in Civil3D/AutoCAD):

- **SAVEAS → DXF** for ordinary drawing linework, then **↥ Import DXF**.
- **Export → LandXML** for a Civil3D surface (and/or its COGO points), then
  **↥ Import LandXML (TIN)** — this is the actual bridge format Civil3D
  itself uses for exactly this kind of interop, and it's already a plain,
  regular XML structure — nothing proprietary to decode.

## Notes on the LandXML parser

- Surface points (`<P>`) are read in LandXML's own order, **Northing Easting
  Elevation** — not Easting/Northing.
- A face's point-id references (`<F>`) can carry a leading `-` marking a
  suppressed breakline edge; that's stripped before looking up the id, it's
  not a sign on the point number.
- A `<Surface>` with no faces that actually resolve to 3 real points is
  skipped rather than added as an empty layer.

## Verified

Both parsers, the layer visibility/lock toggles, and the elevation-query
tool (including its lock-exclusion behavior) were exercised end-to-end in a
real headless-browser session against synthetic DXF and LandXML files
covering every supported entity type — zero console errors.
